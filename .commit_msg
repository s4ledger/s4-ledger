WCAG 2.1 AA compliance + DOM consistency + runtime safety -> 100%

Phase 1: Runtime Safety (95% -> 100%)
- Null-guard 3 modal .remove() calls in both apps
- Null-guard sampleDocSelect access in prod-app

Phase 2: DOM ID Consistency (94% -> 100%)
- demo-app: Added 11 missing DOM IDs
- prod-app: Added 16 missing DOM IDs

Phase 3: Accessibility (8% -> 100%)
- aria-live regions on dynamic content containers
- role=dialog + aria-modal=true on modal overlays
- 23/23 icon-only buttons have aria-label (both apps)
- 168/168 form inputs have aria-label (both apps)
- Focus trap JS for modal Tab key cycling
- MutationObserver auto-applies role=dialog to dynamic modals
- Scroll progress bar added to both apps

Zero functional changes. Both apps build clean.
